## 2. Ambiguities / Contradictions

- [x] **Teams vs Department structure**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - PRD mentions "دپارتمان‌ها (تیم‌ها)" and implementation has proper Team entity with full relationships and management
- [x] **Technical requirements in PRD missing**: Section 9 is empty - no guidance on technologies, architecture, or infrastructure. However, implementation uses .NET Core, Entity Framework, SQL Server, ASP.NET Identity
- [x] **Email-to-ticket integration details unclear**: PRD mentions email integration but no technical specification for SMTP, parsing, or processing. Implementation has no email services yet
- [x] **Real-time dashboard definition vague**: "بلادرنگ" mentioned but no specification of update frequency or technology (WebSocket, SignalR, polling). Current implementation is static
- [x] **API Key management scope unclear**: ✅ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED** - API Key authentication middleware exists but not applied to all endpoints. Dashboard uses Identity authentication
- [x] **Freemium 50-ticket limit**: PRD specifies 50 tickets/month limit for freemium but no enforcement logic in codebase
- [x] **CSAT implementation gap**: PRD mentions automatic surveys after ticket closure but implementation only has placeholder scores

## 5. Risks

### 🚨 Critical Risks
- **Business Model Risk**: Freemium 50-ticket limit not enforced - unlimited free usage affects revenue model
- **API Security Risk**: API Key middleware exists but not consistently applied - potential unauthorized access
- **Production Security Risk**: No HTTPS enforcement, rate limiting, or security headers configured

### 🔴 High Risks  
- **Data Loss Risk**: No backup strategy or disaster recovery plan implemented
- **Performance Risk**: No caching strategy - database queries could become bottleneck under load
- **Monitoring Blind Spot**: No error tracking or APM - production issues may go unnoticed
- **Email Dependency Risk**: Password reset and notifications depend on email service not yet implemented

### 🟠 Medium Risks
- **Scalability Risk**: No real-time infrastructure limits dashboard effectiveness for growing user base
- **Integration Risk**: No background job processing - email-to-ticket feature cannot be implemented
- **User Experience Risk**: Limited mobile responsiveness could impact user adoption
- **Maintenance Risk**: No automated testing increases risk of regressions during updates

### 🟡 Low Risks
- **Localization Risk**: Persian-only interface limits international expansion
- **Compliance Risk**: No audit trails for sensitive operations may affect compliance requirements
- **Vendor Lock-in Risk**: Heavy dependency on Microsoft stack (SQL Server, .NET, Azure)
